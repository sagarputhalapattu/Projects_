1. **matches.csv**: Contains match metadata for the 2024 season.  
   - Columns: `season`, `team1`, `team2`, `date`, `venue`, `toss_winner`, `toss_decision`, `winner`, `winner_runs`, `winner_wickets`, etc.  
   - **Shape**: 52 rows √ó 18 columns (52 matches).  

2. **deliveries.csv**: Contains ball-by-ball data for each match.  
   - Columns: `match_id`, `innings`, `ball`, `batting_team`, `bowling_team`, `extras`, `wicket_type`, etc.

#### **3. Key Steps Performed**  

##### **3.1 Data Cleaning**  
- Replaced missing `winner` values for specific matches:  
  - Oman vs Namibia: Winner set to **Namibia**.  
  - Pakistan vs United States: Winner set to **United States of America**.  

##### **3.2 Key Analysis**  
- **Teams with Most Wins**:  
  South Africa and India both lead with **8 wins** in the 2024 season.  
- **Match Outcomes**:  
  - Most wins were by wickets (e.g., United States won by 7 wickets).  
  - Afghanistan won by **125 runs** in one match.  

##### **3.3 Visualization**  
- A bar plot (using `seaborn`) was generated to show the **top 10 teams by number of wins**.  
  *(Note: Plot code is included in the notebook but output is not shown here.)*

#### **4. Tools Used**  
- **Libraries**: `pandas` (data manipulation), `matplotlib`/`seaborn` (visualization).  
- **Data Sources**: CSV files (`matches.csv`, `deliveries.csv`).

#### **5. Insights for Stakeholders**  
1. **Dominant Teams**: South Africa and India are top performers.  
2. **Toss Impact**: Teams winning the toss often choose to **field first** (e.g., West Indies, Namibia).

#### **6. Recommendations**  
- **Team Strategy**: Focus on winning the toss and optimizing fielding decisions.  
- **Player Development**: Invest in high-impact players like RL Chase (West Indies).
